If increase buffer the time for copying will decrease and vice versa, by decreasing the buffer size the time for copying will increase.

If O_SYNC added, them I/O becomes syncrhoronous and copy time increases.
If we tweak buffer size with O_SYNC on we can see that the time will act the same as when O_SYNC was off, though the time it takes
to copy will increase to greater values then before.

The number of syscalls required to copy a file decrease/increase depending when changing the buffer size. Since the syscalls have high cost, decreasing their number will increase our performance.

When changing O_SYNC flag we make read/write synchronous therefore after each syscall
we will wait until the information has been written for file, thus drastically increasing execution time.
